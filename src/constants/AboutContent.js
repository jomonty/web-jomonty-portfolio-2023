    "I'm Josh Montgomery. A full-stack software developer based in Scotland.",

    "I've always been a tinkerer, completely facinated by how things work. Academically strong in maths, I opted to study it at university. After I completed my degree I got a job in energy trading and pricing, where I spent 5 years.",
    "While working in utilities, I spent a lot of time using databases, primarily relational, and tools such as SSMS, VBA and Python to interact with them. Eventually I realised that using these tools was building a desire to understand how software works.",
    "I began to teach myself through self-guided study, online courses and building some personal projects, the more time I spent studying the more I became convinced that this is where I should be working. So, in 2022, I decided to pursue software development as a career and enrolled at CodeClan Glasgow for a 4-month course in professional software development. It was an incredible experience, it built my knowledge, confidence and I massively enjoyed it.",
    "I'm now working as a Software Engineer at Ivanti, continuing my learning both on and off the job.",
