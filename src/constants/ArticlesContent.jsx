      "For my final project at Codeclan, I worked with 2 other students to produce pickup, a community space for litter picking events with user authentication, event creation and a comment system, and continuously updating statistics on communities, events and users. This was a full stack app made using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL on the backend with Javascript, React and Tailwind on the frontend.",
      "Our primary goal was to build a fully functional app, and have both the front and the backend hosted. We achieved this with vercel for the frontend, and neon postgres with a Digital Ocean droplet hosting a java application for the backend.",
      "This project was incredible to work on, from conception through planning and development, it was filled with challenges and I enjoyed it immensely. Early in our planning process I built out an API specifcation using swagger to enable the front and backend to be developed concurrently.",
      "I planned and developed the entirety of the server, learning loads about Java and Spring Boot along the way. Hosting was it's own challenge, but I'm super proud to have managed to get it online and have a working demo.",

      "This was a group project at Codeclan. Our brief was to build a full-stack application using React, Express and MongoDB, and get experience using git in a team. One of our team members is a beekeeper so we decided to build an app to manage apiaries (groups of colonies), colonies and inspections.",
      "Our MVP included a React front-end, an Express/MongoDB backend and CRUD functionality for colonies and inspections, we had extensions covering dynamic display of information on colonies depending on properties of the latest inspection, inclusion of an API call to OpenWeather to show upcoming weather for the colonies, and the capability to have multiple apiaries.",
      "We discovered some challenges early on in the project - we essentially wanted a relational structure in the data model which needed some thought for MongoDB, this was my job. I designed a relational data model for the database, and I designed and built the server using Express, managing to keep the complexity of the logic needed to manage the relational structure (mostly!) abstracted to the server code.",
      "I also implemented a skeleton structure for the client, client-side logic to handle CRUD operations and managed our git workflow as well as problem solving and bug fixing through the full client. Working through this project in a team was a great experience and it really hammered home the importance of a good git workflow.",
